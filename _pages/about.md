## About
Hi, I'm Guangwei Wang, an Assistant Professor at Guizhou University in the School of Mechanical Engineering. My research area includes nonlinear control and precise manipulation, however, I have just enough expertise in autonomous vehicle and robotics to make trouble.

## Work Experience
* 04/2019 - present: Assistant Professor, Guizhou University, China

## Education
* Ph.D. in Electromechanical Engineering, University of Macau, China, 2018
* M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, Guihzou University, China, 2015
* B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, Gusihzou University, China, 2012




<!-- ## Research

My research topics include Micro/Nanorobotics, Biological Manipulation, Intelligent Control, Autonomous Vehicle, etc.
Check my research at [Publications](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) sections.

## Interests

I have passion for Automatic Control, Robotics, Machine Learning and Autonoumous Driving.
Besides my research works, I have completed several online degrees from Udacity. I did some interesting projects during learning them, take a look at [Portfolio](/portfolio) section and my GitHub.
