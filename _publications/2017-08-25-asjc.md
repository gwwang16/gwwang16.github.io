This paper presents the design of a novel adaptive terminal sliding mode controller (ATSMC) and its application to motion tracking control of a piezoelectric‐driven micropositioning system. A nonsingular terminal sliding surface is used to achieve fast and finite‐time convergence for the trajectory tracking, and also to avoid the singularity phenomenon in traditional terminal sliding mode design. An adaptive gain law is developed to update the gain of the proposed controller and to provide stable and chattering‐free control action. The stability of the control system has been demonstrated in the sense of Lyapunov. The ATSMC scheme is established based on the output feedback only, which does not require a state observer and facilitates an easy implementation. The proposed controller is implemented on a field‐programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. Comparison study with three conventional controllers has been conducted. Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
