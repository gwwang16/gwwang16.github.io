**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

- Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
- Build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
- Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
- Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
