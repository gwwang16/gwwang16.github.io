### Overview

The goal in this challenge is pixel-wise identification of objects in camera images. In other words, the task is to identify exactly what is in each pixel of an image! More specifically, you'll be identifying cars and the drivable area of the road. The images below are a simulated camera image on the left and a label image on the right, where each different type of object in the image corresponds to a different color.

The challenge time is from **May 1st 10:00 am PST to June 3rd at 6:00 pm PST**. 

#### Result

I got the rank 19th finally. 

The top 25 (with U.S. work authorization) will be eligible for an interview with Lyft. So, I participated this challenge just for the fun of it.
