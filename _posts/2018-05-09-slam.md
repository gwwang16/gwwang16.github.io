### Summary

1. Design a simple environment with the Building Editor in Gazebo.
2. Teleoperate  robot and manually test SLAM.
3. Create a wall_follower node that autonomously drives robot to map environment.
4. Use the ROS navigation stack and manually commands robot using the 2D Nav Goal arrow in rviz to move to 2 different desired positions and orientations.
5. Write a pick_objects node that commands robot to move to the desired pickup and drop off zones.
6. Write an add_markers node that subscribes to  robot odometry, keeps track of  robot pose, and publishes markers to rviz.



### Getting Started

If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

Clone this repo into the **src** directory of your workspace:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/gwwang16/Home-Service-Robot.git
```

Install dependencies

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ sudo apt-get update
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/Home-Service-Robot/shellscripts
$ chmod +x test_slam.sh
$ chmod +x add_marker.sh
$ chmod +x pick_objects.sh
$ chmod +x wall_follower.sh
$ chmod +x home_service.sh
```

Build the project:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

#### Test SLAM
Manually test SLAM.
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/Home-Service-Robot/shellscripts
$ ./test_slam.sh
```

#### Map the environment with wall following algorithm

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/Home-Service-Robot/shellscripts
$ ./wall_follower.sh
```

Save the map to file 

```
rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/catkin_ws/src/Home-Service-Robot/homebot/world/my_map
```

Select the start and end positions using

```
rostopic echo /amcl_pose
```

It will display the pose info while you clicking any points on the map in rviz with `2D Pose Estimate` button.

#### Map navigation based on the built map

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/Home-Service-Robot/shellscripts
$ ./home_service.sh
```

Select the mode

0 - Auto mode, which would go to the start point and then to drop off position autonomously.

1 - Manual mode, you can select the predefined position as goal position for this robot.
